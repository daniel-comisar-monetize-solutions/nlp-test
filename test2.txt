     BC–302                    BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM


     TS and CG Terminal Circuit
     DESCRIPTION
     In sensor check mode, malfunctions of the speed sensor that cannot be detected when the vehicle is
     stopped are detected while driving.
     Transition to the sensor check mode can be performed by connecting terminals TS and CG of the DLC3
     and turning the ignition switch from OFF to the ON position.
