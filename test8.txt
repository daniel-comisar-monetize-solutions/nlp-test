              TS and CG Terminal Circuit
             DESCRIPTION
             In sensor check mode, malfunctions of the speed sensor that cannot be detected when the vehicle is 
             stopped are detected while driving.
             Transition to the sensor check mode can be performed by connecting terminals TS and CG of the DLC3 
             and turning the ignition switch from OFF to the ON position.
