BRAKE CONTROL – VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM
TS and CG Terminal Circuit
In sensor check mode, malfunctions of the speed sensor that cannot be detected when the vehicle is
stopped are detected while driving.
Transition to the sensor check mode can be performed by connecting terminals TS and CG of the DLC3
and turning the ignition switch from OFF to the ON position.
